bird-based humour
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- crow stealing glasses (with apologies to father ted)
^ very brief cutscene, bird flies away with camera back in isometric view.
you might be able to attack the crow, maybe.


- credit card numbers, nest, over the city

- ??? bird on shoulder ???

- cat eats bird, gets on shoulder. you can talk to the cat and if you do it refuses to leave.



+ ? drinking bird ?

+ ? <Dwarr> Haha. I like the idea of a wedding scene in which a bride throws back her veil to reveal her head is a giant frozen chicken.
<Dwarr> Right after "you may now kiss the bride".
<Dwarr> Kind of like the famous turkey scene in Friends, but instead of being a feel-good sitcom it should have more of a sinister David Lynch vibe.
<Dwarr> Groom (or co-bride?) desperately crying, being forced to go through with the wedding anyway.



- almost-flying bird (e.g. that damn hysterical boss battle in Killer 7)
like you could have a tiny cutscene showing that hysterical flying then not flying, on entry into a small
 room. doing anything not sufficiently stealthy results in the bird just flying.
maybe it has like a gold chain/gold key or something...
